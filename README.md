# DevLab_WebDev_Homework3

This is my attempt at completing Developers Lab 2023, Homework 3. 
The homework consists of 3 tasks.

1.The first task is a Tic Tac Toe game, that can be played by two players at once. The game is played by pointing and clicking, and gives basic feedback to the user (whose turn it is, who the winner is or is it a tie). The game can be restarted by clicking the appropriate icon or it will restart itself in case of a tie.

2.The second task is a palindrome checker that first asks for input and creates the necessary amount of input elements accordingly. User can then add more input elements by clicking the appropriate icon or delete some as needed. Each input takes 1 character (lower or upper letters and spaces). The app checks for a palindrome after each new input, and does the required validation(it only allows letters and spaces). The app displays the appropriate message.

3. The third task is a simple JS image slider, that enables the user to slide through the gallery by clicking the appropriate icons, or by using the left and right arrow keys. Clicking on the image maximizes it to take up 100vh and 100wv.
